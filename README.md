**Project #1:** How old is midia?

The first project is aimed at data tidying and applying basic statistics (t-test, correlation etc) to the real data about mollusk size. 

**Project #2:** Which Boston district is the best?

The second project is focused more closely on applying linear model, its diagnostics and visualization. The data "Boston" was obtained from MASS package (Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L., 1978)

**Project #3:** Down syndrome in mice - which proteins are the key players?

The aim of the third project is to figure out what proteins change their expression level during Down syndrome in mice. Actually, we tried to reproduce the results from [the article](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119491). The skills obtained during this project are: EDA, ANOVA, mixed linear models, PCA, sPLS-DA analysis.

**Project #4:** Survival analysis: does ovarian cancer pose death risk?

The main topic covered by the 4th project is survival analysis. We used ```ovarian``` data (Edmunson, J.H. et al, 1979) from ```survival``` package in R that contains information about 26 patients with ovarian cancer. We tried to predict death time and pinpoint specific factors that may drive death risk in patients with cancer.

**Project #5:** Logistic regression: are exam scores important for admission? 

This project is focused on binomial regression. We used dataset, which includes information about GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores) and GPA (grade point average) results of 400 students, as well as prestige of the undergraduate institution they finished. We are interested in how these factors affect admission into graduate school.

**Project #6:** Decision tree practice.

During this project we tried to classify people into healthy and patients suffering from heart disease based on their clinical parameters such as chest pain type, sex, age, cholesterol level etc.


**Project #7:** Clustering practice.

The last project was aimed at different types of clusterization: K-means and hierarchical clustering. Using these approaches we tried to cluster people into three groups: patients with hernia, patients with spondylolisthesis and healthy people.
